## Introduction {.unnumbered}

Social scientists have at their disposal an expanding array of data measuring very many social behaviours. This is undoubtedly a positive. Previously unmeasurable aspects of human behaviour can now be explored in a large-scale empirical way, whilst already measured aspects of behaviour can be re-evaluated. Such data are nevertheless rarely generated for the sole purpose of social research, and this fact elevates visual analysis approaches in importance due to visualization's emphasis on discovery. When encountering new data for the first time, data graphics help expose complex structure and multivariate relations, and in so doing advance analysis situations where  the questions to be asked and techniques to be deployed may not be immediately obvious.

Visualization toolkits such as [ggplot2](), [vega-lite]() and [Tableau]() have been designed to ease the process of generating data graphics for analysis. There is a comprehensive set of texts and resources on visualization design theory and practice, and several notable *how-to* primers on visualization. However, comparatively few existing resources demonstrate with real data and real social science scenarios *how* and *why* data graphics should be inserted into an analyst's workflow.


This book aims to fill this space. It presents principled workflows, with accompanying code, for using data graphics and statistics in tandem. In doing so it equips readers with critical design and technical skills needed to analyse and communicate with a range of datasets in the social sciences. The book emphasises application. Each chapter introduces concepts and techniques by analysing a real-world dataset located within a social science domain. The ambition is to do so in a way that advances our analysis and understanding of the phenomena being studied in those datasets.

A consequence of this approach is selectivity in the material covered. This is not an exhaustive guide to applied visualization.  That each chapter of the book is grounded in real visual data analysis scenarios hopefully compensates for the selectivity. For example, as is often the case in social data science, we will encounter various unknowns and misdirections. Some of the structure inferred from our analysis may be spurious, or at least subject to uncertainty. We will have to think critically about claims made and techniques used to help guard against over-interpretation and false discovery. As well as learning how (and why) to use graphics and statistics to explore patterns in data, the book demonstrates how to communicate and tell stories with integrity, implementing recent ideas from data journalism.

## Structure, content and outcomes {.unnumbered}

Chapters of the book are divided into *Concepts* and *Techniques*. The *Concepts* sections cover key literature, ideas and approaches that can be leveraged to analyse the dataset introduced in the chapter. In the *Techniques* sections, code examples are provided for implementing the techniques. Each chapter starts with a list of *Knowlegde* and *Skills* outcomes that map to the *Concepts* and *Techniques*. To support the technical elements, chapters have a corresponding computational notebook template file. The templates contain pre-prepared code chunks to be executed. In the early chapters of the book, we aim at brevity in the *Concepts* sections, offset by slightly more lengthy *Techniques* sections. As the book progresses the  balance shifts somewhat, with more involved conceptual discussion and more specialised and abbreviated technical demonstrations.

<!-- Chapters are also accompanied, via the  Appendices, with *Tasks* for readers to complete in order to test learning. Some tasks are technical and require code to be written;  some are more conceptual. To support these tasks, each chapter has a corresponding computational notebook template file. The templates contain pre-prepared code chunks to be executed. As the book progresses, the amount of pre-prepared code in the templates reduces and readers must contribute more code of their own. -->

Readers of the book will learn how to:

* Describe, process and combine social science datasets from a range of sources.
* Design statistical graphics that expose structure in social science data and that are underpinned by established principles in data visualization and cartography.
* Use modern data science and visualization frameworks to produce data analysis code that is coherent and easily shareable.
* Apply modern statistical techniques for analysing, representing and communicating data and model uncertainty.

## Audience and assumed background  {.unnumbered}

The book is for people working in the broadly defined social sciences, including Geography, Public Health, Transportation, Political Science, Business, Economics. It is aimed at postgraduate students and researchers, data journalists, analysts working in public sector, non-governmental and commercial organisations.

All technical examples are implemented using the `R` programming environment; so too every data graphic that appears in this book.  Little prior knowledge of the `R` ecosystem is assumed, but as the chapters progress more advanced concepts and coding procedures are introduced. Whilst the book covers many of the fundamentals of `R` for working with social science datasets, our ultimate aim is to demonstrate through example how data graphics can and should be used in real data analysis. In this way it complements core resources that more fully cover these how-to aspects: *R for Data Science* [@wickham_r_2017], *Tidymodelling with R* [@kuhn_tidy_2023] and *Geocomputation with R* [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019].
