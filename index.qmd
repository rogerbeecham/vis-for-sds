## Motivation {.unnumbered}

Social scientists have at their disposal an expanding array of data measuring very many social behaviours. This undoubtedly is a positive. Previously unmeasurable aspects of human behaviour can now be explored in a large-scale empirical way, while already measured aspects of behaviour can be re-evaluated. These data, and the sorts of analysis approaches that they provoke, elevate visual analysis approaches in importance due to visualization's heavy emphasis on discovery. When encountering new data for the first time, data graphics help rapidly and uniquely expose complex structure and multivariate relations, and in so doing advance analysis situations where  the questions to be asked and techniques to be deployed may not be immediately obvious.

Numerous visualization toolkits such as [ggplot2](), [vega-lite]() and [Tabeleau]() have been designed to ease the process of generating data graphics for analysis. There is a comprehensive set of texts and resources on visualization design theory and practice, and several notable *how-to* primers on visualization. However, comparatively few existing resources demonstrate with real large-scale data and real social science scenarios *how* and *why* visual data analysis approaches can be inserted into an analyst's workflow.


This book aims to fill this space. It presents principled workflows, with accompanying code, for using data graphics and statistics in tandem. In doing so it equips readers with the key critical design and technical skills needed to analyse and communicate with a wide range of datasets in the social sciences. The book emphasises application. Each chapter introduces the fundamentals by analysing a real-world dataset located within various social science domains: Political Science, Crime Science, Urban and Transport Planning. Some of the structure inferred from these datasets will be spurious. It will be necessary to think critically about claims that can be made and about techniques that might be used to help guard against over-interpretation and false discovery. As well as learning how (and why) to use graphics and statistics to explore patterns in data, the book demonstrates how to communicate and tell stories with integrity, implementing recent ideas from data journalism.

## Structure, content and outcomes {.unnumbered}

Chapters of the book are divided into *Concepts* and *Techniques*. The *Concepts* sections discuss key literature, ideas and approaches that might be leveraged to analyse the dataset introduced in the chapter. In the *Techniques* sections, code examples are provided for implementing the discussed techniques. Each chapter starts with a list of *Knowlegde outcomes* and *Skills outcomes* that map directly to *Concepts* and *Techniques*.

Chapters are also accompanied, via the  Appendices, with *Tasks* for readers to complete in order to test learning. Some tasks are technical and require code to be written;  some are more conceptual. To support these tasks, each chapter has a corresponding computational notebook template file. The templates contain pre-prepared code chunks to be executed. As the book progresses, the amount of pre-prepared code in the templates reduces and readers must contribute more code of their own.

After reading the book, you will be able to:

* Describe, process and combine social science datasets from a range of sources
* Design statistical graphics that expose structure in social science data and that are underpinned by established principles in information visualization and cartography
* Use modern data science and visualization frameworks to produce coherent, reproducible data analyses
* Apply modern statistical techniques for analysing, representing and communicating data and model uncertainty

## Audience and assumed background  {.unnumbered}

The book is for people working in the broadly defined social sciences, including Geography, Political Science, Economics, Business, Sociology and Psychology. It is aimed at a borad range of interests and experience levels: postgraduate students and researchers, data journalists, analysts working in public sector, non-governmental and commercial organisations.

All technical examples are implemented using the `R` programming environment. The book assumes only cursory prior knowledge of the `R` ecosystem. However, as the chapters progress more advanced concepts and coding procedures, core to modern data analysis, are introduced. While the book covers many of the fundamentals of `R` for working with social science datasets, it is designed to complement core resources that more fully cover these *how-to* aspects: *R for Data Science* [@wickham_r_2017], *Geocomputation with R* [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019] and .
