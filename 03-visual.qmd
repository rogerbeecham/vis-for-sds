## Introduction


This chapter outlines the fundamentals of visualization design. It offers a position on what effective data graphics should do, before discussing in detail the processes that take place when creating data graphics. You will learn that there is a framework -- a vocabulary and grammar -- for supporting this process which, combined with established knowledge around visual perception, can be used to describe, evaluate and create effective data graphics. Talking about a vocabulary and grammar of data and graphics may sound somewhat abstract, the preserve of Computer Scientists. However, through an analysis of 2019 General Election results data you will appreciate that these concepts underpin most visual data analysis.

## Concepts

Data graphics take numerous forms and are used in many different ways by scientists, journalists, designers and many more. Whilst the intentions of those producing data graphics varies, those that are *effective* generally have the following characteristics:

1. Represent complex datasets graphically: exposing structure, connections and comparisons that could not be achieved easily via other means.
2. Are data rich: present many numbers in a small space.
3. Reveal patterns at several levels of detail: from broad overview to fine structure.
4. Have elegance: emphasise dimensions of a dataset without extraneous details.
5. Generate an aesthetic response: encouraging people to engage with the data or question.


Given these characteristics, consider the data graphics below, which present an analysis of the 2016 US Presidential Election. Both maps use 2016 county-level results data, but the [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/election-results-from-coast-to-coast/) graphic encodes many more data items than the Medium post (see [Table 3.1](table:tbl-wp-data) below).

```{r}
#| label: fig-wp-map
#| fig-cap: "Maps of 2016 US presidential election results. Left - two-colour choropleth in [Medium](https://medium.com/thepensivepost/understanding-rural-america-d9695a6b3516). Right - information-rich data graphic in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/election-results-from-coast-to-coast/) **Note: RB to reproduce WP map for copyright reasons.**."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("/figs/trump_maps.png", error = FALSE)
```


It is not simply the data density that makes the Washington Post graphic successful. The authors usefully incorporate annotations and transformations in order to support comparison and emphasise structure. By varying the height of triangles according to the number of votes cast, the thickness according to whether or not the result for Trump/Clinton was a landslide and rotating the scrollable map 90 degrees, the very obvious differences between metropolitan, densely populated coastal counties that voted emphatically for Clinton and the vast number of suburban, provincial town and rural counties (everywhere else) that voted Trump, are exposed.

### Grammar of Graphics {#sec-grammar}


> Data graphics visually display measured quantities by means of the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, and color.
>
> @tufte_visual_1983

In evidence in the Washington Post graphic is a judicious *mapping* of data to visuals, underpinned by a secure understanding of analysis context. This act of carefully considering how best to leverage visual systems given the available data and analysis priorities is key to designing effective data graphics.

In the late 1990s Leland Wilkinson, a Computer Scientist and Statistician, introduced the *Grammar of Graphics* [-@wilkinson_grammar_1999] as an approach that captures this process of turning data into visuals. @wilkinson_grammar_1999's thesis is that if graphics can be described in a consistent way according to their structure and composition, then the process of *generating* graphics of different types can be systematised. This has obvious benefits for building visualization toolkits: it makes it easy to specify chart types and combinations and helps formalise the process of designing data visualizations. [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb), [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) are all underpinned by *Grammar of Graphics* thinking.

@wilkinson_grammar_1999’s grammar separates the construction of a data graphic into a series of components. Below are the components of the *Layered Grammar of Graphics* on which *ggplot2* is based [@wickham_layered_2010], a slight edit on @wilkinson_grammar_1999’s original work.


```{r}
#| label: fig-gog
#| fig-cap: "Components of @wickham_layered_2010's Layered Grammar of Graphics."
#| echo: FALSE
#| out.width: 80%
include_graphics("/figs/gog.png", error = FALSE)
```
The seven components in @fig-gog are together used to create ggplot2 specifications. The aspects to highlight at this stage are those in <span style="color:#000000;">emphasis</span>, which are required in any ggplot2 specification. The <span style="color:#5A91CA;font-weight:bold">data</span> containing the variables of interest, the `geom` or  <span style="color:#E17637;font-weight:bold">marks</span> to be used to represent data and the aesthetic (`mapping=aes(...)`) attributes, or visual <span style="color:#62B743;font-weight:bold">channels</span>, through which variables are to be encoded.

To demonstrate this, let's generate some scatterplots based on the 2019 General Election data we will be analysing later in the chapter. Two variables worth exploring for association here are: `con_1719`, the change in Conservative vote share by constituency between 2017-2019, and `leave_hanretty`, the size of the Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum, estimated at Parliamentary Constituency level [see @hanretty_areal_2017].

```{r}
#| label: fig-gog-demo
#| fig-cap: "Plots, grammars and underlying ggplot2 specifications for the scatterplot."
#| echo: FALSE
#| out.width: 100%
include_graphics("/figs/gog-demo.png", error = FALSE)
```

In @fig-gog-demo are three plots and underlying ggplot2 specifications. Reading-off the graphics and the associated code, you should get a feel for how ggplot2 specifications are constructed:

1. We start with a data frame, in this case each observation is an electoral result for a Parliamentary Constituency. In the ggplot2 spec this is passed using the pipe operator (`%>%`). We also identify the variables to encode and their measurement <span style="color:#5A91CA;font-weight:bold">type</span>. Remembering the previous chapter, both `con_1719` and `leave_hanretty` are `ratio` scale variables.
2. Next is the encoding (`mapping=aes()`), which determines how the data are to be mapped to visual <span style="color:#62B743;font-weight:bold">channels</span>. A scatterplot is a 2D representation in which horizontal and vertical position varies in a meaningful way, in response to the values of a data set. Here the values of `leave_hanretty` are mapped along the x-axis and the values of `con_1719` are mapped along the y-axis.
3. Finally, we represent individual data items with <span style="color:#E17637;font-weight:bold">marks</span> using the `geom_point` geometry.

In the middle plot, the grammar is updated such that the points are coloured according to `winning_party`, a variable of type categorical `nominal`. In the bottom plot constituencies that flipped from Labour-to-Conservative between 2017-19 are emphasised by varying the transparency (`alpha`) of points. `flipped` is labelled an `ordinal` variable, but strictly it is a `nominal` (binary) variable. Due to the way it is encoded in the plot, constituencies that flipped are given greater visual emphasis and so is perhaps more appropriate to call `flipped` an ordinal variable.

::: {.callout-note}
## On ggplot2 'specifications'
It is understandable if at this stage the specifications in @fig-gog-demo still seem alien to you. We will be updating, expanding and refining ggplot2 specifications throughout this course to support all aspects of modern data analysis: from data cleaning and exploratory analysis through to model evaluation and communication.

### Marks and visual channels

>  Effective data visualization design is concerned with representing data through marks and visual channels in a way that best conveys the properties of the data that are to be depicted.
>
> via [Jo Wood](https://www.gicentre.net/jwo/index)

You might have noticed that in our descriptions of ggplot2 specifications we introduced <span style="color:#E17637;font-weight:bold">marks</span> as another term for *geometry* and visual encoding <span style="color:#62B743;font-weight:bold">channels</span>  as another term for *aesthetics*. We also paid special attention to the <span style="color:#5A91CA;font-weight:bold">data types</span> that are being encoded. *Marks* are graphical elements such as *bars*, *lines*, *points*, *ellipses*  that can be used to represent data items. In ggplot2, these are accessed through the functions prefaced with [`geom_*`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-geoms). Visual *channels* are attributes such as *colour*, *size*, *position* that, when mapped to data, control the appearance of marks in response to the values of a dataset.

*Marks* and *channels* are terms that appear in the interface of Tableau and in vega-lite specifications. They are also used widely in Information Visualization, an academic discipline devoted to the study of data graphics, and most notably by Tamara @munzner_visualization_2014 in her textbook [*Visualization Analysis and Design*](https://www.routledge.com/Visualization-Analysis-and-Design/Munzner/p/book/9781466508910). @munzner_visualization_2014's work synthesises over foundational research in Information Visualization and Cognitive Science testing how effective different visual channels are at supporting different tasks.

```{r}
#| label: fig-munzner
#| fig-cap: "Visual channels to which data items can be encoded, as they appear in @munzner_visualization_2014."
#| echo: FALSE
#| out.width: 90%

include_graphics("/figs/munzner.png", error = FALSE)
```

@fig-munzner is taken from @munzner_visualization_2014 and lists the main visual channels with which data might be encoded. The grouping and order of the figure is meaningful. Channels are grouped according to the tasks to which they are best suited and then ordered according to their effectiveness at supporting those tasks. To the left are *magnitude:order* channels -- those that are best suited to tasks aimed at quantifying data items. To the right are *identity:category* channels -- those that are most suited to supporting tasks that involve isolating, grouping and associating data items.

We can use this organisation of visual channels to make decisions about appropriate encodings given a variable's measurement level. If we wished to convey the magnitude of something, for example a quantitative (`ratio`) variable like the size of the Conservative vote share in a constituency, we might select a channel that has good quantitative effectiveness -- *position on a common scale* or *length*.  If we wished to also effectively identify and associate constituencies according to the political party that was elected, a categorical `nominal` variable, we might select a channel that has good associative properties such as *colour hue*.


### Evaluating designs

The effectiveness rankings of visual channels in Figure @fig-munzner are not simply based on Munzner's preference. They are informed by detailed experimental work  -- @cleveland_graphical_1984, later replicated by @heer_crowdsourcing_2010 -- which involved conducting controlled experiments testing people's ability to make judgements from graphical elements. We can use @fig-munzner to help make decisions around which data item to encode with which visual channel. This is particularly useful when designing data-rich graphics, where several data items are to be encoded simultaneously [e.g. @beecham_on_2021]. The figure also offers a low cost way of *evaluating* different designs against their encoding effectiveness.

To illustrate this, we can use Munzner's ranking of channels to evaluate the Washington Post graphic discussed in @fig-wp-map. [Table 3.2](#tab:wp-eval-size) provides a summary of the encodings used in the graphic. US counties are represented using a peak-shaped *mark*. The key purpose of the graphic is to depict the geography of voting outcomes, and the most effective quantitative channel -- position on an aligned scale -- is used to order the  county marks with a 2D geographic arrangement. With the positional channels taken, the two quantitive measures, *votes cast* and *result margin*, are encoded with the next highest ranked channel, 1D length: height varies according to number of *votes cast* and width according to *result margin*. The marks are additionally encoded with two categorical variables: whether the county-level result was a *landslide* and also the ultimate *winner*. Since the intention is to give greater visual saliency to counties that resulted in a *landslide*, this as an `ordinal` variable, encoded with a quantitative channel: 2D area. The *winning party*, a categorical `nominal` variable, is encoded using colour hue.

Each of the encoding choices used in the graphic follow conventional wisdom in that data items are encoded using visual channels that are appropriate to their measurement level. Glancing down the "rank" column we can also argue that the graphic has high effectiveness. Whilst technically *spatial region* is the most effective channel for encoding `nominal` data, it is already in use in our graphic as the marks are arranged by geographic position. Additionally, it makes sense to distinguish <span style="color:#DB534D;font-weight:bold">Republican</span> and <span style="color:#3879A1;font-weight:bold">Democrat</span> wins using the colours with which they are always represented. Given the fact that the positional channels are in use to represent geographic *location*, length to represent *votes cast* and *vote margin*, the only superior visual channel to 2D area that could be used to encode the *landslide* variable is *orientation*. There are very good reasons for not varying the orientation of the arrow marks. Most obvious is that this would clearly undermine perception of length encodings used to represent the vote margin (width) and absolute vote size (height).

## Visualization design trade-offs
 Data visualization design almost always involves trade-offs. When deciding on a design configuration, it is necessary to prioritise data and analysis tasks, then match representations and encodings that are most effective to the tasks that have the greatest priority. This constrains the encoding options for less important data items and tasks. Good visualization design is sensitive to this interplay between tasks, data and encoding.
:::

### Symbolisation

> Symbolization is the process of encoding something with meaning in order to represent something else. Effective symbol design requires that the relationship between a symbol and the information that symbol represents (the referent) be clear and easily interpreted.
>
> @white_symbolization_2017

Implicit in the discussion above, and when making design decisions, is the importance of [*symbolisation*](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/symbolization-and-visual-variables). From the original Washington Post article, the overall pattern that can be discerned is of population-dense coastal and metropolitan counties voting Democrat -- densely-packed, tall, wide and blue <i style="color:#3879A1;font-weight:bold" class="fas fa-lg fa-angle-up"></i> marks -- contrasted against population-sparse rural and small town areas voting Republican -- short, wide and red <i style="color:#DB534D;font-weight:bold" class="fas fa-angle-up"></i> marks. The graphic evokes a distinctive landscape of voting behaviour, emphasised by its caption: "*The peaks and valleys of Trump and Clinton’s support*".

*Symbolisation* is used equally well in a variant of the graphic emphasising two-party *Swing* between the 2012 and 2016 elections [*note: RB to reproduce this for copyright reasons*]. Each county is represented as a <span style="font-weight:bolder">|</span> mark. The *Swing* variable is then encoded by continuously varying mark angles: counties swinging Republican are angled to the right   <span style="color:#DB534D;font-weight:bold">\/</span>; counties swinging Democrat are angled to the left <span style="color:#3879A1;font-weight:bolder">\\</span>. Although *angle* is a less effective channel at encoding quantities than is *length*, there are obvious links to the political phenomena in the symbolisation -- angled right for counties that moved to the right politically. Additionally, the variable itself might be regarded as cyclic -- or at least it has a ceiling with an important mid-point that requires emphasis. It is worth taking a second look at the full graphic here. Since there is spatial autocorrelation in case trajectories, we quickly assemble from the graphic dominant patterns of Swing to the Republicans (Great Lakes, rural East Coast), predictable Republican stasis (the mid west) and to detect more isolated, locally exceptional Swings to the Democrats (rapidly urbanising counties in the deep south).

[**RB: remove section of perceptual rankings, detection and estimation?**]

### Checking perceptual rankings

We mentioned that Munzner's effectiveness ordering of visual channels is informed by empirical evidence -- controlled experiments that examine perceptual abilities at making judgements from graphical primitives. It is worth elaborating a little on this experimental work, and on how established knowledge in Cognitive Science can be used to inform design choices.

@cleveland_elements_1993 emphasises three perceptual activities that take place when we make sense of data graphics:

* *Detection* : the element of the graphic must be easily discernible.
* *Assembly* : the process of identifying patterns and structure within the graphical elements of the
visualization.
* *Estimation* : the process of making comparisons of the magnitudes of data items from the visual elements used.

These activities can be related to the categories of task outlined earlier. *Detection* is especially important for *selective* and *associative* tasks that involve isolating and grouping data items, whilst *estimation* is necessary for tasks that are *orderable* and *quantitative*, involving the ranking and reading-off of quantities.

### Detection and preattentive processing

 A useful distinction when considering graphical cognition is between processes that are attentive and pre-attentive [@ware_visual_2008]. Attentive processing describes the conscious processing that happens when we attempt to make sense of a visual field. Preattentive processing happens unconsciously and is the type of cognitive processing that allows something to be understood 'at a glance'. Visual items that immediately pop-out to us induce preattentive processing.

The ability to provoke  pop-out -- making some things on a data graphic more easily detectible than others --  relates to *detection*. It can be useful for supporting *selective* and *associative* tasks, and so is often used in a data graphic to encode categorical variables. For example, in the Washington Post graphic the use of colour hue to differentiate and group together counties that voted Republican or Democrat. Preattentive processes can also apply to *assembly*. We naturally construct and assemble patterns that are smooth and continuous when perceiving a graphic and so deviations from this continuity are often attended to unconsciously. An example here would be those urbanising counties in the deep South, which were locally exceptional in swinging to Democrat (to the left).

We can test this preattentive processing by using visual encoding channels to assist a task that requires us to *select* and *associate* visual items. Below are a set of data graphics containing 200 numbers. For each graphic try to scan across the number, isolate or select the number `3`, then group or associate the `3`s together and count the number of instances that they occur. Speed is important here -- so work as quickly as you can.

First, a set of numbers without applying any special encoding to the number `3`.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## Task: click to expose graphic, then count number of occurrences of #3
```{r}
#| label: no-encoding
#| fig-cap: "Encoding: *none*."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("/figs/no-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```
:::

If you were racing to complete the task, I imagine you found it moderately stressful. Let's explore using visual encoding to off-load some of this cognitive effort. We'll start with a visual channel that does not have particularly strong pre-attentive properties: *area*.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## Task: click to expose graphic, then count number of occurrences of #3
```{r}
#| label: area-encoding
#| fig-cap: "Encoding: *area*."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("/figs/area-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```
:::

Using visualization to support the task makes it an order of magnitude easier. But let's explore some visual channels that have even more powerful properties. I mentioned that tilt/angle has preattentive properties where the data items to be emphasised deviate from some regular pattern. In the graphic below, the number `3` is encoded with *tilt* or *angle*.



::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## Task: click to expose graphic, then count number of occurrences of #3
```{r}
#| label: angle-encoding
#| fig-cap: "Encoding: *tilt/angle*."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("/figs/angle-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```
:::

This is in fact more challenging than the size encoding. I think this is most likely because the geometric patterns of the marks used (numbers) is being varied and so this limits the extent to which we unconsciously perceive smoothness and continuity (e.g. limits **assembly**).

Next we'll use a visual channel with known effectiveness at assisting select and associate tasks. *Colour hue* appears as the second-ranked most effective in @munzner_visualization_2014's ordering.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## Task: click to expose graphic, then count number of occurrences of #3
```{r}
#| label: hue-encoding
#| fig-cap: "Encoding: *colour hue*."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("/figs/hue-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```
:::

Finally, though a slightly contrived example, we can use the top-ranked channel according to @munzner_visualization_2014: *spatial region*.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## Task: click to expose graphic, then count number of occurrences of #3
```{r}
#| label: spatial-encoding
#| fig-cap: "Encoding: *spatial region*."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("/figs/spatial-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```
:::

### Estimation

The informal tests above hopefully persuade you of @munzner_visualization_2014's ordering of *identity:category* channels in the right side of @fig-munzner. The ranking of *magnitude:order* channels is also informed by established theory and evidence.

When using data graphics to communicate quantities, certain visual channels are known to induce biases. [Psychophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) is a branch of psychology that develops methods aimed at capturing the often non-linear relationship between the properties of a *stimuli* such as symbol length, area or colour value, and their *perceived response*. Stevens' power law is an empirically-derived relationship that models this effect. The power function takes the form:

$R=kS_n$

Where $S$ is the magnitude of the stimulus, for example, the absolute length of a line or area of a circle, $R$ is the response, the perceived length and area, and $_n$ is the power law exponent that varies with the type of stimulus. If there is a perfect linear mapping between the stimulus and response, $_n$ is 1.

@stevens_subjective_1963' experimental work involved varying the length of lines and areas of squares and deriving power functions for their perception. For length, an exponent of ~1.0 was estimated; for area an exponent of 0.7. So whilst variation in length is accurately perceived, we *underestimate* the size of areas as they increase. @flannery_relative_1971's work, which was concerned with the perception of quantities in graduated point maps, estimated an exponent of 0.87 for the perception of circle size.

Experimental findings vary and so these models of human perception are also subject to variation. Nevertheless, corrections can be applied. In cartography a [Flannery compensation](https://makingmaps.net/2007/08/28/perceptual-scaling-of-map-symbols/) is used when representing quantities with area.

```{r}
#| label: perception
#| fig-cap: "Differences in power law exponents for the perception of variation in length and area."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("/figs/perception.png", error = FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Graphical perception of inference
This early experimental work that tries to understand how encoded quantities are perceived is clearly important. But we use data graphics to do much more than estimate single quantities. If data graphics are to serve as tools for analysis, we also need some confidence that the *inferences* made when studying data using graphics are accurate and reliable. In the Information Visualization domain, experimental work has recently been published exploring the perception of statistical quantities -- location and dispersion [@correll_error_2014], correlation [@rensink_perception_2010; @harrison_ranking_2014; @kay_beyond_2016] and spatial autocorrelation [@klippel_interpreting_2011; @beecham_map_2017] -- in commonly used chart types. More on this later.
:::

### Colour

As demonstrated in the section on pre-attentive processing, colour is a very powerful visual channel. When considering how to encode data with colour, it is helpful to consider three properties:

* *Hue* : what we generally refer to as "colour" in everyday life -- red, blue green, etc.
* *Saturation* : how much  of a colour there is.
* *Luminance/Brightness* : how dark or light a colour is.

The underlying rule when using colour in data graphics is to use properties of colour that match the properties of the data. Categorical `nominal` data -- data that cannot be easily ordered -- should be encoded using discrete colours with no obvious order: colour hue. Categorical `ordinal` data -- data whose categories can be ordered -- should be encoded with colours that contain an intrinsic order: saturation or brightness, usually allocated into gradients. `Quantitative` data -- data that can be ordered and contain values on a continuous scale -- should also be encoded with colours that contain an intrinsic order: saturation or brightness, expressed on a continuous scale.

As we will discover shortly, these principles are applied by default in `ggplot2`, along with access to perceptually uniform schemes. Its [`colorbrewer`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html) scales, for example.

::: {.callout-tip}
## On colour
There are many considerations when using colour to support visual data analysis and communication -- and we will return to these at various points in the course. Lisa Charotte-Rost's [Guide to Colours in Data Visualization](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorguide/) is an excellent summary of the decision-space.

## Techniques {#sec-techniques}

The technical element involves analysing data from the 2019 UK General Election, reported by Parliamentary Constituency. After importing and describing the dataset, you will generate data graphics that expose patterns in voting behaviour. You will do so by writing ggplot2 specifications.

* Download the [03-template.Rmd]() file for this session and save it to the `reports` folder of your `vis4sds` project.
* Open your `vis4sds` project in RStudio and load the template file by clicking `File` > `Open File ...` > `reports/03-template.Rmd`.


### Import

The template file lists the required packages -- `tidyverse`, `sf` and also [`parlitools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parlitools/index.html). Installing `parlitools` brings down the 2019 UK General Election dataset, along with other constituency-level datasets. Loading it with `library(parlitools)` makes these data available to your R session.

The data frame containing 2019 UK General Election data is called `bes_2019`. This stores results data released by [House of Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8749/). We can get a quick overview  in the usual way -- with a call to `glimpse(<dataset-name>)`. The dataset's variables are also described on the `parlitools` [web pages](https://docs.evanodell.com/parlitools/articles/bes-2019.html). You will notice that `bes_2019` contains 650 rows, one for each Parliamentary Constituency, and 118 columns. Contained in the columns are variables reporting vote numbers and shares for the main political parties for 2019 and 2017 General Elections, as well as names and codes (`ID`s) for each Parliamentary Constituency and the county, region and country in which they are contained. You might want to count the number of counties and regions in the UK, and the number of constituencies contained by counties and regions,  using some of the `dplyr` functions introduced in the previous chapter -- for example with calls to `group_by()` and `count()`.

The aim of this analysis is to reinforce ggplot2 specifications. We will be replicating some of the visual data analysis of the 2019 UK General Election in @beecham_using_2020, inspired by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/election-results-from-coast-to-coast/) graphic. For this we need to calculate an additional variable -- Butler Swing [@butler_why_1990] -- which represents the average change in share of the vote won by two parties contesting successive elections. Code for calculating this variable (named  `swing_con_lab`) is in the [03-template.Rmd](/homework/03-homework_files/03-template.Rmd).

Although initially intuitive, the measure takes a little interpretation. A Swing to the Conservatives, which we observe most often in this dataset, could happen in three ways:

1. An increase in Conservative vote share and a decrease in Labour vote share.
2. An increase in both Conservative and Labour vote share, but with the Conservative increase outstripping that of Labour’s.
3. A decrease in both Conservative and Labour vote share, but with the Conservative decline being less severe than that of Labour's.

Different from the US where "third parties" play a negligible role, scenarios 2 and 3 do occur in the UK. You will notice that `swing_con_lab` is a signed value: positive indicates a Swing to Conservative, negative a Swing to Labour.

The only other dataset to load is a `.geojson` file containing the geometries of constituencies, collected originally from [ONS Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) and simplified using [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper). This is a special class of data frame containing a [Simple Features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) `geometry` column.

### Summarise

You may be familiar with the result of the 2019 General Election -- a landslide Conservative victory that confounded expectations. To start, we can quickly compute some summary statistics around the vote.  In the code block below, we count the number of seats won by party and overall vote share by party. For the latter, the code is a little more elaborate than we might wish at this stage. We needed to reshape the data frame using `pivot_wider()` such that each row represents a vote for a party in a constituency. From here the vote share for each party can be easily computed.

Whilst the Conservative party hold 56% of constituencies, they won only 44% of the vote share. The equivalent figures for Labour are 31% and 32% respectively. Incidentally, whilst the Conservatives increased their share of constituencies from 2017 (where they had just 317, 49% of constituencies) their vote share increase was reasonably small -- in 2017 they gained 42.5% of the vote.

Below are some summary statistics computed over the newly created `swing_con_lab` variable. As the Conservative and Labour votes are negligible in Northern Ireland, it makes sense to focus on Great Britain for our analysis of Con-Lab Swing and so the first step in the code is to create a new data frame filtering out Northern Ireland.

```{r}
#| label: bes-stats-swing
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
data_gb <- bes_2019 %>%
  filter(region != "Northern Ireland") %>%
  mutate(
    swing_con_lab=0.5*((con_19-con_17)-(lab_19-lab_17)),
    # Recode to 0 Chorley incoming speaker,Buckingham outgoing speaker --  uncontested seat.
    swing_con_lab=if_else(constituency_name %in% c("Chorley", "Buckingham"),0,swing_con_lab)
  )

data_gb %>%
  summarise(
    min_swing=min(swing_con_lab),
    max_swing=max(swing_con_lab),
    median_swing=median(swing_con_lab),
    num_swing=sum(swing_con_lab>0),
    num_landslide_con=sum(con_19>50, na.rm=TRUE),
    num_landslide_lab=sum(lab_19>50, na.rm=TRUE)
    )

## # A tibble: 1 x 6
##   min_swing max_swing median_swing num_swing num_landslide_con num_landslide_lab
##       <dbl>     <dbl>        <dbl>     <int>             <int>             <int>
## 1     -6.47      18.4         4.44       599               280               120
```

### Plot distributions

```{r}
#| label: histogram
#| fig-cap: "Histograms of Swing variable."
#| echo: FALSE
include_graphics("/figs/hist.png", error = FALSE)
```

Let's get going with some ggplot2 specifications by plotting some of these variables. Below is the code for plotting a histogram of the Swing variable.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
data_gb %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(swing_con_lab)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

A reminder of the general form of the ggplot2 specification:

1. Start with some *data*: `data_gb`.
2. Define the *encoding*: `mapping=aes()`. In this case, we want to summarise over the `swing_con_lab` variable.
3. Specify the **marks** to be used: `geom_histogram()` in this case.

Different from the scatterplot example, there is more happening in the internals of ggplot2 when creating a histogram.  Technically `geom_histogram()` is what @munzner_visualization_2014 would describe as a  *chart idiom* rather than a *mark* (geometric primitive). The Swing variable is partitioned into bins and observations in each bin are counted. The x-axis (bins) and y-axis (counts by bin) is therefore derived from the supplied variable (`swing_con_lab`). Should you wish, you could enter `?geom_histogram` for fuller detail and documentation around controlling bin sizes amongst other things.

You will notice that by default the histogram's bars are given a grey colour. To *set* them to a different colour, add a `fill=` argument to `geom_histogram()`. In the code block below,  colour is set using [hex codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors) -- `"#003c8f"`, based on the theme for this book. The term *set* and not *map* or *encode* is used for principled reasons. Any part of a ggplot2 specification that involves encoding data -- mapping data to a visual channel -- should be specified through the `mapping=aes()` argument. Anything else, for example changing the default colour of marks, their thickness and transparency, needs to be *set* outside of this argument.


```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

data_gb %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(swing_con_lab)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="#003c8f") +
  labs(
    title="Butler two-party Labour-Conservative Swing for Constituencies in GB",
    subtitle="-- 2019 versus 2017 election",
    caption="Data published by House of Commons Library, accessed via `parlitools`",
    x="Swing", y="count"
  )
```

You might have noticed that different elements of a ggplot2 specification are added (`+`) as layers. In the example above, the additional layer of labels (`labs()`) is not intrinsic to the graphic. However, often you will add layers that do affect the graphic itself. For example, the scaling of encoded values (e.g. `scale_*_continuous()`) or whether the graphic is to be conditioned on another variable to generate [small multiples](https://flowingdata.com/tag/small-multiples/) for comparison (e.g. `facet_*()`).

## On histograms
Read this design exposition by [Lunzner and McNamara, 2020](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) for an excellent discussion of the analysis and design considerations when working with histograms. There are of course other *geoms* for summarising over 1D distributions: `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_dotplot()`, `geom_violin()`.
:::

#### Faceting by region

```{r}
#| label: fig-hist-region
#| fig-cap: "Histograms of Swing variable, grouped by region."
#| echo: FALSE
include_graphics("/figs/hist-region.png", error = FALSE)
```

Adding a call to `facet_*()`, we can quickly compare how Swing varies by region (as in @fig-hist-region). The plot is annotated with the *median* value for Swing (4.4) by adding a vertical line layer (`geom_vline()`) and setting its x-intercept at this value. From this, there is some evidence of a regional geography to the 2019 vote: London and Scotland are particularly distinctive in containing relatively few constituencies swinging greater than the expected midpoint; North East, Yorkshire & The Humber, and to a lesser extent West and East Midlands, appear to show the largest relative number of constituencies swinging greater than the midpoint. It was this graphic, especially the fact that London and Scotland look different from the rest of the country, that prompted the scatterplots in @fig-gog-demo comparing gain in Conservative vote shares against the Brexit vote.

### Plot ranks/magnitudes


```{r}
#| label: fig-bars
#| fig-cap: "Plots of vote shares by party."
#| echo: FALSE

Previously we calculated overall vote share by Political Party. We could continue the exploration of votes by region, re-using this code to generate plots displaying quantities but also comparing by region, using marks and encoding channels that are suitable for magnitudes.

To generate a bar chart similar to the left of @fig-bars the `ggplot2` specification would be^[I'm suggesting that you reuse the code to calculate party vote share in the [summarise](/class/03-class/#summarise-1) code block before piping (`%>%`) to the `ggplot2` specification.]:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

data_gb %>%
  # The code block summarising vote by party.
  <some dplyr code> %>%
  ...  %>% #
  # Data frame of vote share by party, piped to ggplot2.
  <summarised data frame>  %>%
  # Ordinal x-axis (party, reordered), Ratio y-axis (vote_share).
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(party, -vote_share), y=vote_share)) +
  # Set colour by website theme.
  geom_col(fill="#003c8f")
```

A quick breakdown of the specification:

1. *Data*: This is the summarised data frame in which each row is a political party and the column describes the vote share recorded for that party.
2. *Encoding*: We have dropped the call to `mapping=`. ggplot2 always looks for `aes()` and so can save some code clutter.  In this case we are mapping `party` to the x-axis, a categorical variable made ordinal by the fact that we reorder the axis left-to-right descending according to `vote_share`. `vote_share` is mapped to the y-axis -- so encoded using bar length, on an aligned scale, an effective channel for conveying magnitudes.
3. *Marks*: `geom_col()` for generating the bars.
4. *Setting*: Again, we've set bar colour according to the website theme and included titles and captions. Optionally we  add a `coord_flip()` layer in order to display the bars horizontally. This makes the category axis labels easier to read and also seems more appropriate for the visual "ranking" of bars.

## ggplot2 themes
ggplot2 themes control the appearance of all non-data items -- font sizes and types, gridlines, axis labels. Checkout the complete list of ggplot2's [default themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html). If you like the look of the BBC's in-house data graphics, explore their [Data Journalism cookbook](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/). We'd recommend working through the cookbook as it is a great resource for distilling many of the non-data-related decisions that are made when communicating graphically.

#### Faceting by region

```{r}
#| label: fig-bars-region
#| fig-cap: "Plots of vote shares by party and region."
#| echo: FALSE

include_graphics("/figs/bars-region.png", error = FALSE)
```


In @fig-bars-region the graphic is faceted by region. This requires an updated derived dataset grouping by `vote_share` *and* `region` and of course adding a faceting layer (`geom_facet(~region)`) to the ggplot2 specification^[Again you will reuse and **update** the code to calculate party vote share in the [summarise](/class/03-class/#summarise-1) code block before piping (`%>%`) to the ggplot2 specification.]. The graphic is more data-rich, but additional cognitive effort is required in relating the bars representing political parties between different graphical subsets. We can assist this *identify* and *associate* task by encoding the bars with an appropriate visual channel: *colour hue*. The ggplot2  specification for this is as you would expect -- we add a mapping to `geom_col()` and pass the variable name `party` to the fill argument (`aes(fill=party)`).

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

<derived_data> %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(party, vote_share), y=vote_share)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill=party)) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~region)
```

Trying this for yourself, you will observe that the `ggplot2` internals are clever here. Since `party` is a categorical variable, a categorical (hue-based) colour scheme is automatically applied. Try passing a quantitative variable (`fill=vote_share`) and see what happens.

Clever as this is, when encoding political parties with colour *symbolisation* is important. More control over the encoding is necessary in order to specify the colours with which parties are most commonly represented. We can override ggplot2's default colour by adding a `scale_fill_manual()` layer into which a vector of hex codes describing the colour of each political party is passed (`party_colours`). We also need to tell ggplot2 which element of `party_colours` to apply to which value of `party`. In the code below, a derived table is generated summarising `vote_share` by political party and region. In the final line the `party` variable is recoded as a [`factor`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html). You might recall from the last chapter that factors are categorical variables of fixed and orderable values, called `levels`. The call to `mutate()` recodes `party` as a factor variable and orders the levels according to overall vote share.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

# Generate derived data.
temp_party_shares_region <- data_gb %>%
  select(constituency_name, region, total_vote_19, con_vote_19:alliance_vote_19) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=con_vote_19:alliance_vote_19, names_to="party", values_to="votes") %>%
  mutate(party=str_extract(party, "[^_]+")) %>%
  group_by(party, region) %>%
  summarise(vote_share=sum(votes, na.rm=TRUE)/sum(total_vote_19)) %>%
  filter(party %in% c("con", "lab", "ld", "snp", "green", "brexit", "pc")) %>%
  mutate(party=factor(party, levels=c("con", "lab", "ld", "snp", "green", "brexit", "pc")))
```
Next, a vector of objects is created containing the hex codes for the colours of political parties (`party_colours`). This is a named vector, with names assigned from the `levels` of the `party` variable that was just created.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

# Define colours.
con <- "#0575c9"
lab <- "#ed1e0e"
ld <- "#fe8300"
snp <- "#ebc31c"
green <- "#78c31e"
pc <- "#4e9f2f"
brexit <- "#25b6ce"
other <- "#bdbdbd"

party_colours <- c(con, lab, ld, snp, green, brexit, pc)
names(party_colours) <- levels(temp_party_shares_region %>% pull(party))
```

The ggplot2 specification is then updated with the `scale_fill_manual()` layer:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

temp_party_shares_region %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(party, vote_share), y=vote_share)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill=party)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=party_colours) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~region)
```

## Grammar of Graphics-backed visualization toolkits
The idea behind visualization toolkits such as [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is to insert visual data analysis approaches into the Data Scientist's workflow. Rather than being overly concerned with low-level aspects of drawing, mapping to screen coordinates and scaling factors, the analyst instead focuses on aspects crucial to analysis -- exposing patterns in the data by carefully specifying an encoding of data to visuals. Hadley Wickham talks about the type of workflow you will see used throughout this book -- bits of `dplyr`  to prepare data for charting before being piped (`%>%`) to a `ggplot2` specification -- as equivalent to a [grammar of interactive graphics](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Towards-a-grammar-of-interactive-graphics).

The process of searching for, defining and inserting manual colour schemes for creating @fig-bars-region might seem inimical to this. Indeed we were reluctant to include this code so early -- there is some reasonably advanced `dplyr` and a little [regular expression](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html) in the data preparation code that you should not be overly concerned with. However, having control of these slightly more low-level properties is sometimes necessary even for supporting exploratory analysis, in this case for enabling a *symbolisation* that is clear and easily interpretable.  Try relating the bars without our manual setting of colours by political party -- it certainly requires some mental gymnastics.

### Plot relationships

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatters-con
#| fig-cap: "Plots of 2019 versus 2017 vote shares."
#| echo: FALSE

include_graphics("/figs/scatters-con.png", error = FALSE)
```

In the @sec-grammar we demonstrated how scatterplots are specified in `ggplot2`. Scatterplots are useful examples for introducing `ggplot2` specifications as they involve working with genuine  mark primitives (`geom_point()`) and can be built up using a wide range of encoding channels.

To continue the investigation of change in vote shares for the major parties between 2017 and 2019, Figure \@ref(fig:scatters-con) contains scatterplots of vote share in 2019 (y-axis) against vote share in 2017 (x-axis) for Conservative and Labour. The graphics are annotated with a diagonal line. If constituencies voted in 2019 in exactly the same way as 2017, the points would all converge on the diagonal, points above the diagonal indicate a larger vote share than 2017, those below the diagonal represent a smaller vote share than 2017. Points are coloured according to the winning party in 2019 and constituencies that flipped from Labour to Conservative are emphasised using transparency and shape.

The code for generating most of the scatterplot comparing Conservative vote shares is below.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

data_gb %>%
  mutate(winner_19=case_when(
           winner_19 == "Conservative" ~ "Conservative",
           winner_19 == "Labour" ~ "Labour",
           TRUE ~ "Other"
         )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=con_17, y=con_19)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=winner_19), alpha=.8) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c(con,lab,other)) +
  ...
```

Hopefully there is little surprising here:

1. **Data**: The `data_gb` data frame. Values of `winner_19` that are not *Conservative* or *Labour* are recoded to *Other* using a **conditional statement**. This is because points are eventually coloured according to winning party, but the occlusion of points adds visual complexity and so I've chosen to prioritise the two main parties and recode remaining parties to other.
2. **Encoding**: Conservative vote share in 2017 and 2019 are mapped to the x- and y- axes respectively and `winner_19` to colour. `scale_colour_manual()` is used for customising the colours.
3. **Marks**: `geom_point()` for generating the points of the scatterplot; geom_abline() for drawing the reference diagonal.

## On conditionals
You will have encountered conditionals in the reading from last session. `case_when` allows you to avoid writing multiple `if_else()` statements. It wasn't really necessary here -- I could have used a single if_else with something like:

```
data_gb %>%
  mutate(
    winner_19=if_else(!winner_19 %in% c("Conservative", "Labour"), "Other", winner_19)
  )
```

A general point from the code blocks in this session is of the importance of proficiency in `dplyr`. Throughout the book you will find yourself needing to calculate new variables, recode variables, and reorganise data frames before passing through to `ggplot2`.

### Plot geography

```{r}
#| label: fig-map-winners
#| fig-cap: "Choropleth of elected parties in 2019 General Election."
#| echo: FALSE

include_graphics("/figs/map-winners.png", error = FALSE)
```

In the graphics that facet by region, our analysis suggests at a geography to voting and certainly to observed changes in voting comparing the 2017 and 2019 elections (e.g. @fig-hist-region). We end the session by encoding the results data with a spatial arrangement -- we'll generate some maps.

To do this we need to define a join on the boundary data (`cons_outline`):

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

# Join constituency boundaries.
data_gb <- cons_outline %>%
  inner_join(data_gb, by=c("pcon19cd"="ons_const_id"))
# Check class.
## [1] "sf"         "data.frame"
```


The code for generating the [Choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) of winning party by constituency in @fig-map-winners:
```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

# Recode winner_19 as a factor variable for assigning colours.
data_gb <- data_gb %>%
  mutate(
    winner_19=if_else(winner_19=="Speaker", "Other", winner_19),
    winner_19=as_factor(winner_19))

# Create a named vector of colours
party_colours <- c(con, lab, ld, green, other, snp, pc)
names(party_colours) <- levels(data_gb %>% pull(winner_19))

# Plot map.
data_gb %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill=winner_19)) +
  geom_sf(colour="#eeeeee", size=0.01)+
  # Optionally add a layer for regional boundaries.
  # geom_sf(data=. %>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(), colour="#eeeeee", fill="transparent", size=0.08)+
  coord_sf(crs=27700, datum=NA) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=party_colours)
```

A breakdown of the `ggplot2` spec:

1. *Data*: The `dplyr` code updates `data_gb` by recoding `winner_19` as a factor and defining a named vector of colours to supply to `scale_fill_manual()`.
2. *Encoding*: No surprises here -- `fill` according to `winner_19`.
3. *Marks*: `geom_sf()` is a special class of geometry. It draws objects depending on the contents of the `geometry` column. In this case `MULTIPOLYGON`, so read this as a *polygon* geometric primitive.
4. *Coordinates*: `coord_sf` -- we set the coordinate system (CRS) explicitly. In this case [OS British National Grid](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/osgb-1936-british-national-grid/). More on this later in the course.
5. *Setting*: I've subtly introduced light grey (`colour="#eeeeee"`) and thin (`size=0.01`)  constituency boundaries to the `geom_sf` mark. On the map to the right outlines for regions are added as another `geom_sf` layer.


```{r}
#| label: fig-spoke-map
#| fig-cap: "Map of Butler Con-Lab Swing in 2019 General Election."
#| echo: FALSE

include_graphics("/figs/spoke-map.png", error = FALSE)
```
This has been a packed session. I'm providing a very abbreviated introduction to map design with `ggplot2` and want to reserve the details of how `ggplot2` can be used in more involved visualization design for later in the course. Since the graphic has been discussed at length, it would be strange not to demonstrate how the encoding in the Washington Post piece can be applied here to analyse our Butler two-party swing variable [e.g. @beecham_using_2020].

First, some helper functions -- converting degrees to radians and centring `geom_spoke()` geometries. Don't bother yourself with these details, just run the code.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

# Convert degrees to radians.
get_radians <- function(degrees) {
  (degrees * pi) / (180)
}
# Rescaling function.
map_scale <- function(value, min1, max1, min2, max2) {
  return  (min2+(max2-min2)*((value-min1)/(max1-min1)))
}
# Position subclass for centred geom_spoke.
# As per https://bit.ly/3yfXdKJ.
position_center_spoke <- function() PositionCenterSpoke
PositionCenterSpoke <-
    ggplot2::ggproto('PositionCenterSpoke', ggplot2::Position,
        compute_panel = function(self, data, params, scales)
            {
                data$x <- 2*data$x - data$xend
                data$y <- 2*data$y - data$yend
                data$radius <- 2*data$radius
                data
            }
    )
```
Next re-define `party_colours`, the object we use for manually setting colours, to contain just three values: hex codes for Conservative, Labour and Other.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE


party_colours <- c(con, lab, other)
names(party_colours) <- c("Conservative", "Labour", "Other")
```



And the `ggplot2` specification:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

max_shift <- max(abs(data_gb %>% pull(swing_con_lab)))
min_shift <- -max_shift

gb <- data_gb %>%
  mutate(
    is_flipped=seat_change_1719 %in% c("Conservative gain from Labour","Labour gain from Conservative"),
    elected=if_else(!winner_19 %in% c("Conservative", "Labour"), "Other", as.character(winner_19))
    ) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf(aes(fill=elected), colour="#636363", alpha=.2, size=.01)+
  geom_spoke(
             aes(x=bng_e, y=bng_n, angle=get_radians(map_scale(swing_con_lab,min_shift,max_shift,135,45)), colour=elected, size=is_flipped),
             radius=7000, position="center_spoke"
             )+
  coord_sf(crs=27700, datum=NA)+
  scale_size_ordinal(range=c(.3,.9))+
  scale_colour_manual(values=party_colours)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=party_colours)
```

A breakdown:

1. *Data*: `data_gb` is updated with a boolean identifying whether or not the Constituency flipped Con-Lab/Lab-Con between successive elections (`is_flipped`), and a variable simplifying the party elected to either Conservative, Labour or Other.
2. *Encoding*: `geom_sf` is again filled by elected party. This encoding is made more subtle by adding transparency (`alpha=.2`). [`geom_spoke()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_spoke.html) is a line primitive that can be encoded with a location and direction. It is mapped to the geographic centroid of each Constituency (`bng_e` - easting, `bng_n` - northing), coloured according to elected party, sized according to whether the Constituency flipped its vote and tilted according to the Swing variable. Here I've created a function (map_scale) which pegs the maximum Swing values in either direction to 45 degrees (max Swing to the right, Conservative) and 135 degrees (max Swing to the left, Labour).
3. *Marks*: `geom_sf()` for the Constituency boundaries,  `geom_spoke()` for the angled line primitives.
4. *Scale*: `geom_spoke()` primitives are sized to emphasise whether constituencies have flipped. The size encoding is censored to two values with `scale_size_ordinal()`. Passed to `scale_colour_manual()` and  `scale_fill_manual()` is the vector of `party_colours`
5. *Coordinates*: `coord_sf` -- the CRS is [OS British National Grid](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/osgb-1936-british-national-grid/).
6. *Setting*: The `radius`, the of `geom_spoke()` primitives is a sensible default arrived at through trial and error, its `position` set using our `center_spoke` class.

## Conclusions

Visualization design is ultimately a process of decision-making. Data must be filtered and prioritised before being encoded with  marks, visual channels and symbolisation. The most successful data graphics are those that expose structure, connections and comparisons that could not be achieved easily via other, non-visual means. This session has introduced concepts -- a vocabulary, framework and empirically-informed guidelines -- that helps support this decision-making process and that underpins modern visualization toolkits (`ggplot2` included). Through an analysis of UK 2019 General Election data, we have demonstrated how these concepts can be applied in a real data analysis.
